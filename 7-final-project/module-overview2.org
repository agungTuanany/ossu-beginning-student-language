* Space Invaders Project: Domain Analysis

In this final project, you will complete the design of the classic arcade game
Space Invaders. If you've never played it before, you can get an idea of how it
works [[https://www.pacxon4u.com/space-invaders/][here]].

There are many different version of Space Invaders. For this Project, your Space
Invaders game should have the following behavior


- The tank should move right and left a the bottom of the screen when you press
  the arrow keys.  If you press the left arrows key, it will continue to move
  left at a constant speed until you press the right arrow key.

- The tank should fire missiles straight up from its current position when you
  press the space bar.

- The invaders should appear randomly along the top of the screen and move at a
  45 degree angle. When they hit a wall they will bounce off and continue at a
  45 degree angle in the other direction.

- When an invaders reaches the bottom of the screen the game is over.

This is an example of what the game should look like during play. The arrows
have been added on to show you how the different parts of the game move.

Designing this program will require many of the things you have learned
throughout the course, and it will be the largest program you have worked on
Before downloading the starter file on the next page, some time to become
acquainted with the game, and complete the domain analysis for the program.
