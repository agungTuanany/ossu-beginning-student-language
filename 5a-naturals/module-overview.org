* Module overview

This module deals with functions operating on Natural numbers. It turns out that
this builds naturally on the self-reference module.


The last video in the module is a bit of brain candy. Or perhaps it's a brain
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobstopper. It's kind of wild, and intended to show
you how much power you wield as a program designer. Have it fun with it. But if
it's too much feel free to come back to it later. If you do master it then avoid
the temptation to tell people you meet about it at party. You may find them
smiling politely and backing away from you a bit.

Working through the videos and practice for this module should take
approximately 3-4 hours of dedicated time to complete.

* Learning Goals

- Be able to design functions that operate on natural numbers.

- Be able to design a simple alternative representation for natural numbers.
