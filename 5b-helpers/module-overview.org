* Module Overview

In this module, we learn several new rules for breaking design problem into
pieces, learning several rules for breaking a function down into multiple
functions.

The good news is that while the problems get larger, the work to do that at any
moment in time does not get harder. Most of the work is HtDD and HtDF work you
already know how to do. That's the contribution of the design method, to reduce
ever more complex problems to smaller pieces you know hot to solve.

Working through the videos and practice materials for this module and the design
quiz take approximately 6-9 hours of dedicated time to complete.

* Learning Goals

Be able to design functions that use helper functions for each the following
reasons:

- at references to other non-primitives data definitions (this will be in the
  template)
- to form a function composition
- to handle a knowledge domain shift
- to operate on arbitrary sized data.
