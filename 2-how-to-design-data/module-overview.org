* Module Overview

In this module we begin learning how to design data representation of problem
domain information.  While systems tend to have more function designs than data
designs, the design of the data turns out to drive the design of the
functions. So data design is a critical part of program design.


Working through the video and practice materials for this module should take
approximately 5-8 hours of dedicated time to complete.

* Learning Goals

- Be able to use the How to Design Data Definition (HtDD) recipe to design data
  definition for atomic data.

- Be able to identify problem domain information that should be represented as
  simple atomic data, intervals, enumerations, itemizations and mixed data
  itemizations.

- Be able to use the How to Design Function (HtDF) recipe to design functions
  operating on atomic data.
