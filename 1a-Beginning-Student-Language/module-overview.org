* Beginning Student Language

This page provides an overview of the material for the first module of the
course including topics, learning goals, estimate of time required and study
tips. Each module of the course will start with similar page which you can
always access from the navigation bar to the left.


In this course we use especially designed programming language called Beginning
Student Language (BSL). The BSL language is small and simple, and you will be
able to learn most of it in this first module. It simplicity has two benefits.
First it allows us to spend more time on learning the design method which is the
real focus of the course. In addition, because BSL forms the core of nearly
every other language you will ever use, learning the design method using BSL
will help you adapt the material you learn in this course to other programming
languages.

This course is primarily target at students who have never programmed before, so
for many of you this will be your first programming language. The video in this
module are paced with that in mind. The videos go through not just the language
but also the tools we will be using.  Please avoid the temptation to skim this
material.

For students who have already programmed, this module may seem to easy - but be
careful!  Be sure to learn *this programming language*. While this language
forms the conceptual core of nearly every programming language you might have
used, it also different in important ways. Take the time to go through this
material carefully.

Working through the videos and practice materials for this module should take
approximately 5-8 hours of dedicated time to complete.

* Learning Goals

- Be able to write expression that operate on primitive data including numbers,
  strings, images, booleans.

- Be able to write constant and function definitions.

- Be able to write out the step-by-step evaluation of simple expression
  including function calls.

- Be bale to use the stepper to automatically step through the evaluation of an
  expression.

- Be able to use the Dr Racket help desk to discover new primitives.
