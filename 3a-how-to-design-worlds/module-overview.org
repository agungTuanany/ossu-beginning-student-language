* Module Overview

In this module you will learn how to design interactive programs that use the
DrRacket big-bang functionality. We will make simple animations of animals
walking across the screen that can be controlled by th keyboard and the
mouse. In learning this process we also cover basic techniques for systematizing
your work on a larger programs. This module is complement by the Compound
module, which allows us to create more complex data definitions, that in turn
support more complex world programs.


NOTE: Several of the videos in this module are quite long. That in because they
work through the entire process of designing an interactive program. As a
result, much of what the videos cover is not new. Instead it is HtDF and HtDD
problems you already know how to do. We could have made the videos shorter by
only including the new material, but many students have told us that they
appreciate the longer videos because it helps them see how all the pieces fit
together. As always, we suggest you use some of these videos as a kind of TA
tutorial hours - try to work the problem on your own and check in with the video
now and then to see how your solution compares to ours.

Working through the videos and practice materials for this module should take
approximately 3-6 hours of dedicated time to complete.

* Learning Goals

- Be able to explain the inherent structure of interactive graphical programs.

- Be able to use How to Design World (HtDW) recipe to design interactive
  programs with atomic world state.

- Be able to read and write big-bang expression.
