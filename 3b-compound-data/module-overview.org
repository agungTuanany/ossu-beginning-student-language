* Module Overview

In this module you will learn how to design compound data definitions to represent
information that consists of two or more naturally connected values, as well
how to use such data s world state in HtDW problems.

NOTE: several of the videos this module are quite long. That is because they work
through entire process of designing an interactive program. As a result, much
of what the videos cover is not new. Instead it is HtDF and HtDD problems you already
know how to do. We suggest that you use these videos as a kind of TA tutorial hours -
try to work the problem on your own and check in with the video now and then to see
how your solution compares to ours.

Working through the videos and practice materials for this module should take
approximately 5-7 hours of dedicated time to complete.

* Learning Goals

- Be able to identify domain information that should be represented as compound data.

- Be able to read and write define-struct definitions.

- Be able to design function that consumes and/or produce compound data.

- Be able to design world programs that use compound state world state.
