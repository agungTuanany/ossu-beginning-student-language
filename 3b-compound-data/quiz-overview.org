This project will have 3 phases:

    In step one, you will design a solution to a given problem.
    In step two, you will watch an assessment tutorial video (found in the next tab).
    In step three, you will do a self-assessment of your solution.

PROBLEM:

Design a World Program with Compound Data. You can be as creative as you like,
but keep it simple. Above all, follow the recipes! You must also stay within the
scope of the first part of the course. Do not use language features we have not
seen in the videos.

If you need inspiration, you can choose to create a program that allows you to
click on a spot on the screen to create a flower, which then grows over time. If
you click again the first flower is replaced by a new one at the new position.

You should do all your design work in DrRacket. Following the step-by-step
recipe in DrRacket will help you be sure that you have a quality solution.

For this quiz you will be asked to design a world program using the HtDW and
other recipes. Your solution will be assessed according to the following rubric:

    - Is the program safe?
	The program file should be set to beginning student language and there
	should be no require declarations other than (require 2htdp/image) and
	(require 2htdp/universe). If the program is in a language other than BSL,
	then it gets 0 points for the rest of the rubric.
    - Is the program "commit ready"?
	The file should be neat and tidy, no tests or code should be commented out
	other than stubs and templates and all scratch work should be removed.
    - Are all HtDW elements complete and do they have high internal quality?
	All HtDW elements should be present, well formed, and have high internal
	quality. The file must include Constants, Data Definitions and
	Functions. The Constants section must be complete, there must be a main
	function that is correct and operates on a compound type. The main function
	must have all necessary big-bang options, and for each option, the handler
	must be present in the file.
    - Are all HtDD elements complete and do they have high internal quality?
	Examine the Data Definition for the world state. All elements of HtDD must
	be present and have high internal quality. This includes a structure
	definition, type comment, interpretation, examples and the template.
    - Are all HtDF elements complete and do they have high internal quality?
	Choose either the to-draw, on-key or on-mouse handler. All elements of HtDF
	must be present and have high internal quality. This includes the Signature,
	Purpose, Stub, Examples/Tests, Template and the Function Body.
    - Does the design satisfy the problem requirements?
	The program must be a World Program, operate on Compound Data, and be within
	the scope of the course.
